# 3 in 1 Arcade Game

**Course:** Computer Graphics  
**Term:** Fall 2024-25  
**Section:** F  
**Group:** 11  

## Project Overview

We are developing a single-player game using OpenGL, inspired by classics like Agent XIAO: The Shooting Game, Pac-Man, and Breakout. Built with C++ and GLUT, the project features smooth gameplay, dynamic graphics, real-time collision detection, particle effects, and intuitive controls.

### Key Highlights:

- Fast-paced, score-based gameplay.
- Advanced visual effects and physics integration.
- Focus on enhancing skills in graphics programming and game mechanics.

This project blends the charm of classic games with modern techniques, delivering an engaging and immersive gaming experience. This project is submitted as part of the course requirements for **Computer Graphics** at the **Faculty of Science and Technology, American International University-Bangladesh**.

## About

Our OpenGL-based project brings the essence of classic arcade games to life, combining timeless gameplay mechanics with modern graphical enhancements. Drawing inspiration from Agent XIAO: The Shooting Game, Pac-Man, and Breakout, the games are designed as single-player, score-driven challenges that emphasize precision, speed, and engagement.

## Acknowledgments

We extend our gratitude to our instructor, **Mahfujur Rahman**, for guiding us throughout the course and inspiring this project.

# Multi-Game Application
